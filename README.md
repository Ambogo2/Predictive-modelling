# Diabetes Analysis

## Project Overview
This project was done during my internship at [Meriskill](!https://www.meriskill.com/) and the objective was to to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on various diagnostic measurements

## About the Dataset
The dataset was originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.
In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage 2
The dataset includes several features (independent variables).
It has only one target variable (Outcome) indicating whether a patient has diabetes (1 for positive, 0 for negative).

### Features 

* Pregnancies: The number of pregnancies a patient has going through.
* Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration( an indicator of blood sugar levels).
* Blood Pressure: Diastolic blood pressure.
* Skin Thickness: Skinfold thickness (related to body composition).
* Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin level.
* BMI: A measure of body weight and height (indicating body fat).
* Diabetes Pedigree Function: A measure of the diabetes heredity risk based on family history.
* Age: The age of the patient in years.
* Target Variable: Indicates whether the patient has diabetes (1 for positive, 0 for negative).

## Analysis
**Tool used**: Jupyter notebook

## Insights
* The data was analysed from 336 patients, with a total insulin level of 52K.
* The avwerage age of a patient is 32, BMI 32.30, and blood pressure 70.24.
* The average skin thickness is at 28.66, and glucose levels at 122.
  
The findings I uncovered offers actionable insights that can pave the way for better healthcare solutions.
It's an excellent example of the impact data analysis can have in the healthcare sector
